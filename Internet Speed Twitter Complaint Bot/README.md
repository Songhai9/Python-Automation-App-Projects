# Twitter complaining bot

In this project, we create a bot that complain about its Internet speed by
sending a tweet to the Internet provider if the connection speed is not
above the minimum guaranteed on the contract.

It uses a selenium webdriver to open a speed test, and uses the result to decide
whether it should complain or not
